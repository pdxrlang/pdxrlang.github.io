## Study group

This is a sub-group of `pdxrlang`, that is essentially an R study group. Right now, they are meeting to go through the Coursera John Hopkin's R Programming course (https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog). This group is organized by Audrey Julian.

They generally meet once every week, on the weekend.
