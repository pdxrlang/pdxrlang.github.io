# Welcome to PDXRLANG!

We are the local R user group for Portland, Oregon.  R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics (http://www.r-project.org/).  Our goal is to support and share R experience and knowledge among its users in the Portland community.

We aim to have meetups once per month.
