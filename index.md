__Propose a talk! [https://sckott.typeform.com/to/ShM55K](https://sckott.typeform.com/to/ShM55K)__

We are the local R user group for Portland, Oregon. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.  Our goal is to support and share R experience and knowledge among its users in the Portland community.

We aim to have meetups once per month.

Follow news about the group on Twitter at [`@pdxrlang`](https://twitter.com/pdxrlang)

Join other pdxrlang'ers and other portland area data science folks at our slack <https://pdxdata.slack.com>
