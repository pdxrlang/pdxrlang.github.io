## Welcome to PDXRLANG!

We are the local R user group for Portland, Oregon. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.  Our goal is to support and share R experience and knowledge among its users in the Portland community.

We aim to have meetups once per month.
